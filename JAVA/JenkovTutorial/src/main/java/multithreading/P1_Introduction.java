/*In concurrent programming, there are two basic units of execution: processes and threads. 
 * In the Java programming language, concurrent programming is mostly concerned with threads.
 * 
 * Threads exist within a process â€” every process has at least one. 
 * Threads share the process's resources, including memory and open files. 
 * This makes for efficient, but potentially problematic, communication.
 * 
 * Creating Threads:
 * 	1) Extending Thread class
 *  2) Implementing Runnable interface
