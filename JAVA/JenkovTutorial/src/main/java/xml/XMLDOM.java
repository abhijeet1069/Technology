/*
 JAVA uses following tools to process XML:
 	1. SAX Parser
 		Can be used only to read XML not write it.
 	2. STAX Parser
 		Streaming API for reading and writing XML streams. 
 	3. DOM Parser
 		DOM(Document Object Model) parser parses an XML document into an object graph. However, object graph takes a lot of concurrency.memory.
 	4. XPath Evaluator
 		Built in JAVA library.
 	5. XSL Processor
 		XSL processor transforms an input XML document to an output document according to an XSL stylesheet.
 	6. JAXB 
 	Similar to DOM parser
 	
 	XML in many situations is being replaced by JSON as data exchange format. Web browsers can parse JSON natively, which makes
 	JSON an easier data exchange format to use between browsers and web servers.
