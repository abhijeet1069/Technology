Computer Evolution:
    Rotatating cylinders -> Relays -> Vaccum Tubes (Electrical Computers (ENIAC)) -> Transistors
    Bare Metal Software - Software running without OS
    
OS operation:
    Application Software -> OS(System Libraries, Kernel, Device Drivers) -> Computer Hardware

Teletype(TTY):
    Similar to a typewriter.

In old motherboards:
    Northbridge - Embedded chip that transfers data between the CPU and the RAM
    Southbridge - Embedded chip that transfers data between the RAM and devices that are connected via slow interfaces like PCI, USB, SATA
Nowadays, chip feature a more integrated design.

The compilation process consists of two steps:
    a) Compiling - Source code is converted into object files.
    b) Linking - The object files are combined to produce the final executable file.

A command shell provides access to the settings and functions of the OS. We can perform:
    Run programs and system services.
    Manage the file system.
    Control peripheral and internal devices.
    Access the kernel features.
